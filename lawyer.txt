I see, so you chose to make your mother proud and become a lawyer. Your mother is ecstatic,
your father wanted you to be a doctor but is also happy. you made your parents proud, but now
you will never live your dream to be a computer scientist. but on the bright side your parents paid your full tuition for your
Yale law school.

Your mom was helping you pack for Yale law school. she told that you were going to make here so proud and that the rest of the family
is going to be so jealous when my son becomes a lawyer. you feel mad and disappointed that she does not care about your feelings.
do you want to say how you feel?

1: yes
2: no
