you decided to go to make a good impression since you just to college. when you guys get there,
you realized that his sister is the same girl that made you stomach twisted and made your heart skip a beat.
will says that her name is alex. "its was nice to meet you" alex says

after will goes to the bathroom you ask alex if she wants to go on a date, she says no because
she barely know you and calls you a creep. you run back to your room embarrassed and wanting to go home.
